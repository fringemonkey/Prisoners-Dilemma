## 🌟 **What is this?**

This is an **interactive simulation** that brings the famous Prisoner's Dilemma to life! Instead of just reading about game theory, you can actually **see** how different strategies play out over time.

Think of it like a **digital petri dish** where you can watch different "personalities" compete and evolve!

## 🎮 **What can you do?**

### **🐟 Watch Strategies Come Alive**
- **Fish Tank View**: See your strategies as swimming fish in a virtual ecosystem
- **Real-time Evolution**: Watch populations grow, shrink, and adapt
- **Visual Cooperation**: See which strategies work together and which don't

### **🧪 Run Experiments**
- **Single Simulations**: Test one scenario at a time
- **Batch Testing**: Try hundreds of different combinations automatically
- **Parameter Tweaking**: Adjust settings and see what happens

### **📊 Understand the Results**
- **Simple Charts**: Easy-to-read graphs showing what happened
- **Strategy Rankings**: See which approaches performed best
- **Population Changes**: Watch how strategies spread or disappear

## 🚀 **Quick Start (No Tech Knowledge Required!)**

1. **Visit the app**: [https://fringemonkey.github.io/Prisoners-Dilemma/](https://fringemonkey.github.io/Prisoners-Dilemma/)
2. **Click "Fish Tank"** to see the fun visual view
3. **Click "Simulation"** to run your first experiment
4. **Watch what happens!**

## 🎯 **What is the Prisoner's Dilemma?**

The Prisoner's Dilemma is a famous puzzle that shows why two people might not cooperate even when it's in their best interest to do so.

**Simple Example:**
- Two people are arrested for a crime
- If both stay quiet (cooperate), they each get 1 year in jail
- If one rats out the other (defects), the rat goes free, the other gets 3 years
- If both rat each other out, they each get 2 years

**The Problem:** Even though cooperating is better for both, each person has an incentive to defect!

## 🐠 **The Fish Tank - See Strategies in Action!**

Our newest feature turns abstract strategies into **living, breathing fish**:

- **Blue Fish (Tit for Tat)**: "I'll do what you did last time"
- **Green Fish (Always Cooperate)**: "I'll always be nice"
- **Red Fish (Always Defect)**: "I'll always be selfish"
- **Purple Fish (Pavlov)**: "I'll adapt my behavior"
- **Yellow Fish (Random)**: "I'll do whatever I feel like"

Watch them swim around, form schools, and compete for survival!

## 🔬 **Built-in Strategies to Explore**

### **The Classics**
- **Tit for Tat**: Start nice, then copy what your opponent does
- **Always Cooperate**: Always be nice (sometimes gets taken advantage of)
- **Always Defect**: Always be selfish (doesn't make friends)

### **The Smart Ones**
- **Pavlov**: Learn from experience and adapt
- **Gradual**: Start nice, get mean if provoked, then forgive
- **Tit for Two Tats**: Give people a second chance

### **The Wild Cards**
- **Random**: Make random decisions
- **Grudger**: Never forgive a betrayal
- **Soft Majority**: Do what most others are doing

## 🎨 **Features That Make Learning Fun**

### **Visual Learning**
- **Color-coded strategies** make it easy to spot patterns
- **Animated charts** show changes over time
- **Interactive controls** let you experiment in real-time

### **Multiple Views**
- **Fish Tank**: See strategies as living creatures
- **Charts**: Traditional graphs and statistics
- **Timeline**: Watch evolution happen step by step

### **Easy Experimentation**
- **One-click simulations** for quick tests
- **Batch testing** for thorough exploration
- **Save and share** your favorite results

## 🌍 **Why This Matters**

Understanding the Prisoner's Dilemma helps explain:
- **Why countries don't always cooperate** on climate change
- **Why businesses sometimes compete** instead of working together
- **How trust and reputation** work in society
- **Why some strategies succeed** while others fail
